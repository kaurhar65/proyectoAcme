##### Introduction

The purpose of this project is to create a web app that allows workers of a company to book meeting rooms at a given date and time.

It has two elements: a web API that interfaces with a Microsoft SQL Server database to manage both the room and reservation information and user authentication, and a front-end that runs on the browser.

The web API is written in C#, using an entity/controller model based on Asp.NET Core and EntityFramework Core.
For authentication and authorisation, Asp.NET Core Identity was used, together with the Asp.NET Core JwtBearer namespace. Successful authentication sends a JWT token to the user, which is then included in requests to the API as an authorisation header.

The front-end app is written in Angular and TypeScript.

##### Project structure

###### Database contexts

The app has two database contexts, which point to the same Microsoft SQL Server database:
- the **ApplicationDbContext** class, which is used for user and role management and extends the default **IdentityDbContext** class.
- the **RoomsApiCrudDbContext** class, which is used for CRUD operations on meeting room and reservation data and extends the default **DbContext** class. This context contains a **DbSet** object for each of the entities it manages.

###### Meeting room API structure

The meeting room booking CRUD API works with the following elements:  

- **Entities**  
Those are classes that represent the database schema of the corresponding tables.  
	- **Country** */Entities/Country.cs*  
	This class represents the countries the meeting rooms are in.  
	*Schema*  
		- Id: int, autoincrement  
		- Name: string  
	- **City** */Entities/City.cs*  
	This class represents the cities the meeting rooms are in.  
	*Schema*  
		- Id: int, autoincrement  
		- Name: string  
		- CountryId: int  
		This field is a reference to the **Country** entity.  
	- **Office** */Entities/Office.cs*  
	This class represents the offices the meeting rooms are in.  
	*Schema*  
		- Id: int, autoincrement
		- Name: string
		- CityId: int  
		This field is a reference to the **City** entity.  
	- **Room** */Entities/Room.cs*  
	This class represents the meeting rooms.  
	*Schema*  
		- Id: int, autoincrement
		- Name: string
		- OfficeId: int  
		This field is a reference to the **Office** entity.  
	- **Reservation** */Entities/Reservation.cs*  
	This class represents the reservations of the meeting rooms.  
	*Schema*  
		- Id: int, autoincrement
		- Date: DateTime
		- StartTime: DateTime
		- EndTime: DateTime
		- RoomId: int  
		This field is a reference to the **Room** entity.  
		- UserId: int  
		This field is a reference to the **IdentityUser** class.  
					
- **Controllers**  
	Those are classes that specify the HTTP methods of the web API and their exposed endpoints.  
	- **CountryController** *Controllers/CountryController.cs*  
	This class contains CRUD operations on the **Countries** DbSet.  
	*Methods*

- **Database**  
	The database tables were created from the **Entities** using EntityFramework Core migrations. That means their schema and names are identical to those of the aforementioned **Entities**.

###### Meeting room API authorisation

Authorisation is achieved by attaching an **Authorization header** to the HTTP requests, containing the **Bearer keyword**, which indicates that the Token Bearer authentication scheme is being used, followed by the **JWT token** that was obtained on login.

Example:  

	{
		"Authorization": "Bearer ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ.1234567890.QWERTYUIOP"  
	}
	
###### User management and authentication API structure

The user management and authentication API works with the following elements:  
	
- **Models**  
	Those are classes that represent the input fields of register and login forms.  
	
	- **IdentityUser** *Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity package dependency*  
	This class represents the default user model and is **purely for internal use**.   
	- **IdentityRole** *Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity package dependency*  
	This class represents the default user role and is **purely for internal use**.  
	- **RegisterModel** */Models/RegisterModel.cs*  
	This class represents the fields of the register form.  
	*Schema*  
	All fields are required.  
		- UserName: string  
			This property represents the UserName property of the default **IdentityUser** class.
		- Password: string  
			For security reasons, this property is not stored in the database. Rather, the **IdentityUser** class contains a PasswordHash property that contains an automatically generated hash of the password, created using the **HMAC-SHA512** algorithm and an iteration count of 210,000, in accordance to OWASP recommendations.  
			In order for the registration request to be successful, the password must contain:  
			- At least one non alphanumeric character.
			- At least one digit.
			- At least one uppercase letter.
			- At least one lowercase letter.
			- At least 6 characters.
		- Email: string  
			This property represents the Email property of the default **IdentityUser** class.
		- Phone: string  
			This property represents the PhoneNumber property of the default **IdentityUser** class.
	- **LoginModel** */Models/LoginModel.cs*  
	This class represents the fields of the register form.  
	*Schema*  
	All fields are required.  
		- UserName: string
		- Password: string
	- **UserRoles** */Models/UserRoles.cs*  
	This class contains the names of the possible instances of the default **IdentityRole** class that the app uses.  
	*Schema*  
		- Admin: string  
			Value is set to "Admin", and is immutable.
		- User: string  
			Value is set "User", and is immutable.

- **Controllers**  
	Those are classes that specify the HTTP methods of the authentication API and their exposed endpoints.  
	
	- **AuthenticationController** */Controllers/AuthenticationController.cs*  
	This class contains HTTP request methods for authentication operations.  
	*Methods*  
		- **GetToken**  
		This is a private utility method for **internal use**. It takes a **List\<Claim\>** object containing authentication claims and returns a newly generated **JWT token** in the form of a **JwtSecurityToken** object.
		- **Post**
			- **Register**  
			This method creates an user with no special **UserRole**.  
				- Route:  
					*api/Authentication/Register*
				- Parameters:  
					none
				- Request body:  
					An instance of the **RegisterModel** class, in JSON format.
				- Return value:  
					none
				- Response code:  
					200 *(success)*  
					500 *(failure)*  
			- **RegisterAdmin**  
			This method creates an user with the Admin **UserRole**.  
				- Route:  
					*api/Authentication/RegisterAdmin*
				- Parameters:  
					none
				- Request body:  
					An instance of the **RegisterModel** class, in JSON format.
				- Return value:  
					none
				- Response code:  
					200 *(success)*  
					500 *(failure)*  
			- **Login**  
				- Route:  
					*api/Authentication/Login*
				- Parameters:  
					none
				- Request body:  
					An instance of the **LoginModel** class, in JSON format.
				- Return value:  
					A **JWT token** in JSON format.
				- Response code:  
					200 *(success)*  
					401 *(unauthorised)*  
- **Database**  
The database tables were created from the default Asp.NET Core Identity model using EntityFramework Core migrations.
Those tables are handled by calls from the controller to Asp.Net Core Identity methods, and **should not be accessed directly**.  
The database contains the following tables:  
	- AspNetRoles  
	This table stores all possible user roles.  
	*Schema*  
		- Id: nvarchar, PK  
		- Name: nvarchar  
		- NormalizedName: nvarchar  
		- ConcurrencyStamp: nvarchar  
	- AspNetRoleClaims
		This table maps roles to claims in an N-to-M relationship.
	- AspNetUsers  
	This table stores the registered users.  
	*Schema*  
		- Id: nvarchar, PK  
		- UserName: nvarchar  
		- NormalizedUserName: nvarchar  
		- Email: nvarchar  
		- NormalizedEmail: nvarchar  
		- EmailConfirmed: bit  
		- PasswordHash: nvarchar  
		- SecurityStamp: nvarchar  
		- ConcurrencyStamp: nvarchar  
		- PhoneNumber: nvarchar  
		- PhoneNumberConfirmed: bit  
		- TwoFactorEnabled: bit  
		- LockoutEnd: nvarchar  
		- LockoutEnabled: bit  
		- AccessFailedCount: int  
	- AspNetUserRoles  
		This table maps users to roles in an N-to-M relationship.
	- AspNetUserClaims  
		This table maps users to claims in an N-to-M relationship.
	- AspNetUserTokens  
		This table stores tokens and maps them to users, and is unused in the current implementation of the app, as the authorisation tokens are simply stored in memory.
	- AspNetUserLogins  
		This table maps users to external login providers, and is unused in the current implementation of the app.
